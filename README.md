- 🎙️ Fun fact:
  Each time you shuffle a standard deck of 52 playing cards, it's highly probable that the resulting order has never existed before in the universe.
  With a staggering 52 factorial possible permutations (approximately 8 x 10^67), this number surpasses the estimated atoms in the observable universe.
  So, every shuffle likely creates a unique order never seen before!
